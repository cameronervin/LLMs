    "### What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework is a method used in natural language processing that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality of generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Document Chunking:** The first step in RAG involves breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable chunks. This process is known as chunking. Each chunk should be of a size that can be efficiently processed by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Turning Chunks into Vectors:** Once the documents are chunked, each chunk is transformed into a high-dimensional vector. This is typically done using a pre-trained language model that generates embeddings for each chunk. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Storing Vectors in a Vector Database:** The generated vectors are then stored in a vector database. Vector databases are specifically designed to handle high-dimensional data and allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and similarity search of vectors. They are well-suited for storing and retrieving the high-dimensional arrays produced during the training of large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Query Encoding:** When a query is received, it is also encoded into a vector using the same pre-trained language model. This ensures that the query vector is in the same high-dimensional space as the document vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Similarity Search Using Cosine Similarity:** The query vector is then compared to the vectors stored in the vector database to find the most relevant chunks. This comparison is typically done using cosine similarity, which measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors. Cosine similarity is effective in determining the similarity between vectors regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Retrieving Relevant Chunks:** Based on the cosine similarity scores, the most relevant chunks are retrieved from the vector database. These chunks are considered to be the most semantically similar to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Generating the Final Response:** The retrieved chunks are then used as context for generating the final response. A generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses these chunks to produce a coherent and contextually relevant response to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Diagram of the RAG Process\n",
    "<img src=\"https://developer-blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rag-architecture.png\" alt=\"NVIDIA RAG\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: By incorporating relevant external information, RAG models can generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The retrieval mechanism allows the model to access a vast amount of information without the need to store all knowledge within the generative model itself.\n",
    "- **Flexibility**: RAG can be applied to various NLP tasks, including question answering, dialogue systems, and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits for Businesses\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tailored Solutions**: RAG enables businesses to customize foundation large language models (LLMs) to their specific needs by integrating domain-specific knowledge. This allows for more relevant and precise responses that align with business requirements.\n",
    "- **Improved Customer Support**: By leveraging RAG, businesses can enhance their customer support systems with accurate and contextually relevant responses, leading to higher customer satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Knowledge Management**: RAG can be used to efficiently manage and utilize large volumes of internal documents, making it easier for employees to access and leverage critical information.\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: By using retrieval mechanisms, businesses can reduce the computational costs associated with training and maintaining large generative models, as the need for extensive fine-tuning is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question Answering**: Providing precise answers to user queries by retrieving relevant documents and generating concise responses.\n",
    "- **Dialogue Systems**: Enhancing conversational agents by incorporating external knowledge to maintain context and provide informative replies.\n",
    "- **Summarization**: Generating summaries of documents by retrieving key passages and synthesizing them into a coherent summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG represents a powerful approach in the field of NLP, combining the best of retrieval and generation techniques to produce high-quality, contextually aware responses. By leveraging external knowledge sources, RAG models can significantly enhance the performance and applicability of NLP systems across various domains. For businesses, RAG offers the added advantage of tailoring foundation LLM models to meet specific needs, thereby improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall operational effectiveness.\n"

    "### LangChain and LangGraph. What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain and LangGraph are powerful tools designed to facilitate the integration and implementation of large language models (LLMs) in various applications. These tools provide a programmatic approach, enabling developers to harness the capabilities of LLMs efficiently and effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a framework designed to facilitate the creation of applications that leverage large language models (LLMs) by enabling the chaining of various LLM components together. This approach allows developers to build complex workflows where the output of one model or process can seamlessly become the input for another, enhancing the overall functionality and efficiency of the application. By creating pipelines, LangChain optimizes the use of LLMs, allowing for more sophisticated and context-aware interactions, improved task automation, and the ability to handle multi-step processes more effectively. This modularity and flexibility are particularly beneficial in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding and generation of language, thereby significantly expanding the potential use cases of generative AI technologies.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is an advanced framework designed to enhance the capabilities of LangChain by introducing a more structured and flexible way to manage and execute complex workflows involving large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to create and manage graphs of interconnected components, where each node represents a specific task or function, and the edges define the data flow between these tasks.\n",

    "##### Advancements with LangGraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Structured Workflow Management:** LangGraph provides a more organized approach to building workflows. By representing tasks as nodes in a graph, it allows for better visualization and management of complex processes, making it easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Enhanced Flexibility:** The graph-based structure enables more flexible and dynamic workflows. Developers can easily add, remove, or modify nodes and edges to adapt to changing requirements without having to rewrite the entire pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Parallel Processing:** LangGraph supports parallel execution of tasks, which can significantly speed up processing times for workflows that can be decomposed into independent tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Improved Modularity:** By breaking down workflows into discrete, reusable components, LangGraph promotes modularity. This makes it easier to develop, test, and maintain individual parts of the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Use of Agents:** LangGraph integrates the concept of agents, which are autonomous entities that can perform specific tasks within the workflow. Agents can reason about how to fulfill a request, plan the necessary steps, and execute the plan. This capability allows for more intelligent and autonomous operations, reducing the need for manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "![LangGraph Diagram](https://blog.langchain.dev/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/Screenshot-2023-11-27-at-8.22.59-PM-1.webp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain and LangGraph offer powerful tools for developers looking to implement and manage large language models programmatically. By providing modular, scalable, and easy-to-use frameworks, these tools enable the creation of sophisticated NLP solutions tailored to specific business needs.

    "## Now, It Is Time to Implement RAG, LangChain, & LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining our Problem\n",
    "Today, we will be creating a MultiAgent LangGraph system that can achieve the following:\n",
    "1) Take a specific ML research paper\n",
    "2) Analyze the contents of the paper\n",
    "3) Perform further research when necessary on specific topics within the paper\n",
    "4) Write a response to a user's prompt given the information in the paper and the information found during research\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other important notes:\n",
    "- There will be two different MultiAgent teams with an overall supervisor - a research team and a writing team. Each team will have a supervisor which dictates what actions to take. There will also be a supervisor overseeing the entire process. \n",
    "\n",
    "- On the research team there will be two agents: a search agent utilizing [Tavily](https://tavily.com/), a search engine for AI agents, and a document search agent searching for information in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the writing team there will be three agents: a writer writing the final content, a note taker compiling information, and a copy editor agent that fixes grammar, puncuation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent will have various tools at their disposal to achieve their roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each supervisor will oversee their respective team, and the head supervisor will oversee the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Additionally, each team is its own separate LangGraph. There will be a complete LangGraph that connects the writing and researching graphs as nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The layout of the total system is as follows:\n",

       "  HumanMessage(content='The paper \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\" presents a study on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models which combine pre-trained parametric (e.g., sequence-to-sequence models) and non-parametric (e.g., a dense vector index of Wikipedia) memory for language generation tasks. Here are the main takeaways from the paper:\\n\\n1. RAG models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks, particularly in knowledge-intensive areas.\\n\\n2. The authors fine-tuned and evaluated their models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, including three open-domain QA tasks, where they outperformed parametric sequence-to-sequence models and task-specific retrieve-and-extract architectures.\\n\\n3. RAG models consist of a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model as the parametric memory and a dense vector index of Wikipedia as the non-parametric memory, which is accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever.\\n\\n4. The results from using RAG models for language generation tasks show that these models generate more specific, diverse, and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only sequence-to-sequence baseline.\\n\\n5. Moreover, the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models\\' knowledge as the world changes, making RAG models adaptable to new information.\\n\\n6. The paper provides a general-purpose fine-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation, implying broad applicability to various NLP tasks.\\n\\n7. The work sets a new benchmark in the field and provides a pathway for future research in combining retrieval methods with language generation to enhance NLP systems.\\n\\nThe paper is authored by Patrick Lewis, Ethan Perez, Aleksandra Piktus, Fabio Petroni, Vladimir Karpukhin, Naman Goyal, Heinrich Küttler, Mike Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Tim Rocktäschel, Sebastian Riedel, and Douwe Kiela, primarily from Facebook AI Research and University College London.

    "#### Aha! So that's what RAG is! Good thing we have our MultiAgent system in case my explanation at the beginning wasn't clear enough!\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced NLP framework that enhances text generation by integrating retrieval-based and generation-based methods. It involves breaking documents into manageable chunks, transforming these chunks into high-dimensional vectors, storing them in a vector database, and using cosine similarity to retrieve relevant chunks for generating contextually accurate responses. RAG's advantages include enhanced contextual understanding, scalability, and flexibility, making it valuable for tasks like question answering, dialogue systems, and summarization. For businesses, RAG offers tailored solutions, improved customer support, efficient knowledge management, and cost efficiency. LangChain and LangGraph are complementary tools designed to facilitate the integration and implementation of large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables the chaining of various LLM components to create complex workflows, enhancing task automation and context-aware interactions. LangGraph builds on this by introducing a structured, graph-based approach to manage and execute workflows, supporting parallel processing, modularity, and the use of intelligent agents. Together, these tools empower developers to efficiently harness the capabilities of LLMs for sophisticated NLP applications tailored to specific business needs."
